To navigate to my code please visit my public GitHub account at \

\
To run and get graphs please \
1. cd to my above ML directory\
2. Run python run_optimized.py for part1 of assignment\
3. Run python run_neuralnetwork.py for part2 of assignment\

\
Since it takes time to generate all the graphs for all algorithms, I have split the code into different algorithms for saving time.\
